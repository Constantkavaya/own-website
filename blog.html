                <p class="intro">When Abel  marries Patricia is able to make promise  to Patricia that he will stop smoking weed, since patricia wanted the best for her ,but we see that he is able to engage in drinking alcohol. And this costs ,patricia much in her life where it made her one day she decide to acompany Trevor  to the police station  to report abuse, but we see learn Abel is able to come up strongly and defend himself concerning that case and this shows that in the society women have no say over the males and what they are entailed to do is to be  submissive to an exted that women they are supposed to kneel infront of their husbands when serving meals .To relate this  allegations on our societies today women are denied the chance  perform duties that brings income to them instead they are seen as a tool where their duty entails looking after their children and their husbands.They are also entailed to be submissive to respect every descion that is being said by their husbands since the society does not allow them to go aganist  rule <br> whether its bad or good since they are under their husbands authority.</p>

                <p>Humor is demonstrated in the book where Trevor suprises the boys who wanted to steal from him and were talking to him in their mother tongue by showing them he understood what they were saying.Hence this help Trevor to make  new friends and get out of the trouble.Humor is also demonstrated <br>where Trevor is being pused out of the car by the mother and this was  achieved when we see that it was able to save live.Humor was also,illustrated when their car broke down during sunday and and Trevor was courageous enough to tell her mother that God made sure that their car broke down so that they could not go to church,so that they could rest the same way God rested and her mother replied to him telling him that ,that was the devil who was talking to him but I guess so here they were also trying to show the Importance of devotion and  how people have excuses when it comes to spiritual matters.Trevoh noah  also used hyperbole to present the fact of his birth in a humorous way where he continues saying that ,when her mother's delivery was taking place,the doctors cut open her belly,and reached in and pulled out a half white half black child in real sense a child cant be born a half black and white but in the other words I feel like Trevor was<br> trying to demonstrate that doctors are never concerned about the welfare of the child or the mother.</p>
